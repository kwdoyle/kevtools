# kevtools
Useful (semi) universal functions I've written for stats and other work-related things.

To install, basically just run this:
```R
library(devtools)

setwd(".")  # change to this directory whichever way you want
install("kevtools")
```
Or, the alternatively quicker (and better) way to do this without needing to clone the repo would be:
```R
devtools::install_github('kwdoyle/kevtools')
```
